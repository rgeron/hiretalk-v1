EXPLANATION OF THE PROJECT

This project is a B2B SaaS platform that aims to revolutionize the recruitment process by replacing traditional cover letters with instant AI-powered voice interviews.

When a candidate applies for a job, instead of submitting a cover letter, they receive a link to complete an automated interview. During the call, an AI agent asks personalized questions about their motivation, relevant experience, and skills. The conversation is recorded, transcribed, and analyzed in real-time.

The recruiter then receives:

- A structured summary of the candidate’s responses
- An engagement and soft-skill score (based on clarity, fluency, and structure)
- The full transcript and audio if needed

This approach brings authenticity and friction back to the application process — only motivated candidates will complete the call, acting as a natural filter. It also helps companies save time, improve candidate assessment early in the funnel, and modernize the candidate experience.

The product integrates with existing ATS systems and includes an optional premium layer for advanced AI-driven insights.
