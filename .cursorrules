## Critiqo.io

### Core Features

1. **Review Capture Pages**  
   - Ability to create multiple pages dedicated to gathering reviews from users.  
   - **Pages Flow**:  
     1. **Welcome Page** – Introduces the product/service and explains the review process.  
     2. **Choice of Review Type** – User selects text-based review or video review (if enabled).  
     3. **Review Submission** – User writes the review text or records a short (max 90 seconds) video.  
     4. **User Info Collection** – Basic details (Name, Email, Role (optional), Profile Image).  
     5. **Thank You Page** – A final message confirming submission.  
   - **Customization**:  
     - Text content (headers, descriptions)  
     - Primary color (theme-based)  
     - Background color (theme-based)  
   - **Live Preview**:  
     - An admin/editor interface with fields on the left, live preview on the right.  
     - All customizations saved in a JSON config (type-safe with Prisma schemas).

2. **Review Moderation & Listing**  
   - **Review List**:  
     - Displays all reviews in a paginated table (20 reviews per page).  
     - Shows basic info (user name, image, partial text or video thumbnail).  
   - **Moderation**:  
     - Admin can open a review to see the full content, edit details if necessary, then approve or reject it.  
     - By default, reviews must be **approved** before becoming publicly visible.   

3. **Tagging System**  
   - Multiple tags can be assigned to a review (e.g., “Positive”, “Tutorial”, etc.).  
   - Tags can be inherited automatically from the review page configuration.  
   - Admin can add or remove tags during moderation.  
   - Dedicated UI for managing tags (create, rename, delete).

4. **Video Handling with Mux**  
   - Users can upload video reviews up to **1 minute 30 seconds**.  
   - Mux handles compression, conversion, and automated thumbnail generation.  
   - We store references to Mux assets for playback within the app.

5. **Public Sharing of Review Pages**  
   - A publicly accessible URL for each review page (e.g., `critiqo.io/:orgSlug/reviewPageId`).  
   - Uses smooth animations (via `framer-motion` or similar) across the steps:
     1. Welcome  
     2. Capture (text or video)  
     3. Basic info  
     4. Thank you  
   - Once a review is submitted, an email notification is sent to the **organization’s email**.

6. **Widgets for Displaying Reviews**  
   - Embed code to display a masonry grid of reviews on any external site.  
   - **Styling**:  
     - Primary color, background color, and text are customizable (within reason).  
     - Masonry layout (multiple columns, responsive).  
     - “Load More” button to fetch additional reviews.  
   - **Tag-based Filtering**:  
     - Widget can show only reviews with certain tags, or all reviews.  

7. **Widget to Encourage Reviews**  
   - A small widget (popup) that appears (e.g., bottom-left corner) after a configurable time interval.  
   - Clicking it redirects the user to the dedicated review page.

8. **Notifications**  
   - When a review is submitted, only the **organization’s email** is notified.  
   - No separate notifications on approval or rejection for the reviewer.
