description: EXPLAIN how authentification work and HOW to use it
globs: *.tsx, *.ts

## Context

* We use NextAuth to handle authentification in our application.
* Our application create helper to simplify the usage of retreiving the user.

## Example

To get the current user, you must use `auth` function :

```ts
import { auth, requiredAuth } from "@/lib/auth/helper";

// user is optional
const user = await auth();
// throw an error if user is not defined
const user = await requiredAuth();
```

`requiredAuth` will throw an `unauthorized` method that will be catch by `unauthorized.tsx`. You can check [nextjs-routes.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/nextjs-routes.mdc).
