Mux is a service to upload video and stream video. Here is how it's work.

You must not invente anything and ask for documentation or use the Mux Documentation.

## Node SDK

Exemple upload video

```tsx
import Mux from '@mux/mux-node';
const mux = new Mux({
  tokenId: process.env.MUX_TOKEN_ID,
  tokenSecret: process.env.MUX_TOKEN_SECRET
});

mux.video.uploads.create({
  cors_origin: 'https://your-browser-app.com', 
  new_asset_settings: {
    playback_policy: ['public'],
    video_quality: 'basic'
  }
}).then(upload => {
  // upload.url is what you'll want to return to your client.
});
```

## Frontend SDK

Play video :

```tsx
import MuxPlayer from "@mux/mux-player-react"; 

export default function App() {
  return (
    <MuxPlayer
      playbackId="a4nOgmxGWg6gULfcBbAa00gXyfcwPnAFldF8RdsNyk8M"
      metadata={{
        video_id: "video-id-54321",
        video_title: "Test video title",
        viewer_user_id: "user-id-007",
      }}
    />
  );
}
```
