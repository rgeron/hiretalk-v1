globs: 
---
Organization define a multi-tenant model. Every table is linked to an organization instead of a user. Every table about organization is defined in [organization.prisma](mdc:prisma/schema/organization.prisma).

## Methods

- You muse always use organization for resources. Everything must be linked to an organization, not a user.

- To get an organization, you can use `getCurrentOrgCache` or `getRequiredCurrentOrgCache` function.

```ts
import { getCurrentOrgCache } from "@/lib/react/cache";

const org = await getCurrentOrgCache();
```

The `cache` version avoid to make the request multiple time.

## Rules

You must always include the organization inside Prisma query to avoid getting data from other organization :

```ts
const { org } = await getRequiredCurrentOrgCache();

const tags = await prisma.tag.findMany({
  where: {
    // Verify the organization
    organizationId: org.id,
  }
});
```
