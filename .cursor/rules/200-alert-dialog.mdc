globs: *.ts, *.tsx

## Context

* DialogManager enables you to show a global popup with many features. The basic one is just a validation dialog:

## Example

```tsx
import { dialogManager } from "@/features/dialog-manager/dialog-manager-store";

dialogManager.add({
  title: "Delete step",
  description: "Are you sure you want to delete this step?",
  action: {
    label: "Delete",
    onClick: async () => {
      // todo 
    }
  },
});
```

## Options

### Input

You can define an input to retreive a value from the alert dialog.

```tsx
dialogManager.add({
  title: "Rename campaign",
  description: "Enter a new name for this campaign",
  input: {
    label: "Name",
    defaultValue: campaign.name,
  },
  action: {
    label: "Rename",
    onClick: async (value) => {
      if (!value) return;
      await renameMutation.mutateAsync({ name: value });
    },
  },
});
```

### Confirm Text

For important action, you can ask a `confirmText` so the user need to type it before going forward.

```tsx
dialogManager.add({
  title: "Delete Segment",
  description:
    "Are you sure you want to delete this segment? This action cannot be undone.",
  confirmText: "DELETE",
  action: {
    label: "Delete",
    onClick: () => {
      deleteMutation.mutate(segment.id);
    },
  },
});
```
