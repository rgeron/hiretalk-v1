## Context

-  Prisma by default does NOT rename tables or properties; it deletes and re-creates them.
-  Your role is to AVOID this data loss by renaming the table.

## Example

Code generated by Prisma: 

```sql
-- AlterTable
ALTER TABLE "Post" DROP COLUMN "content",
ADD COLUMN "markdown" TEXT NOT NULL;
```

Expected result: 

```sql
-- AlterTable
ALTER TABLE "Post" RENAME COLUMN "content" TO "markdown";
```
